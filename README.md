# andriaskitchen

This is my attempt to migrate Andria's Kitchen from the Angular 2.0 to 7. There are more works to do, but I think I have my first 
working web application. Also, I'm moving the data source to Firebase instead of Web API Azure and MongoDB.

For the old source code, please visit:

If you decide to clone this project, remember to run
1. npm install
2. Once done, ng serve should do it for you.
